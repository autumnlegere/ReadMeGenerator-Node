# Accio ReadMe - A ReadMe Generator


## Description

This project generates a ReadMe file using prompts given through the command line. It was built using javascript, node.js, and inquirer package. It allows the user to spend less time formatting and putting together a ReadMe file for their projects by providing a template. The template is filled in using the user's input from the command line prompts. It makes constructing a ReadMe less time consuming, allowing more time to work on the project itself. This is the first time I have used node.js and inquirer. It was a steep learning curve, but I was able to produce the desired mvp.

## Tests

If you would like to test this application, you can enter a small word such as 'no' for each prompt that asks for an input. This will genereate a ReadMe that you will not end up using, but will give you an idea of what the final result will look like before you take the time to thoughtfully answer each prompt.
