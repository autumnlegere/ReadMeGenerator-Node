## Description

This project generates a ReadMe file using prompts given through the command line. It was built using javascript, node.js, and inquirer package. It allows the user to spend less time formatting and putting together a ReadMe file for their projects by providing a template. The template is filled in using the user's input from the command line prompts. It makes constructing a ReadMe less time consuming, allowing more time to work on the project itself. This is the first time I have used node.js and inquirer. It was a steep learning curve, but I was able to produce the desired mvp.

If you would like to see how the application will function before committing to it, I would encourage you to simply fill in ‘yes’ for each input prompt that comes up. Select a random license and the contributor covenant, and then see how the final readme turns out. From there you can determine if this application fits your needs and how the end result will look before committing to use it.
