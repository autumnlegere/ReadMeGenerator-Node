# Accio ReadMe - A ReadMe Generator


## Description

This project generates a ReadMe file using prompts given through the command line. It was built using javascript, node.js, and inquirer package. It allows the user to spend less time formatting and putting together a ReadMe file for their projects by providing a template. The template is filled in using the user's input from the command line prompts. It makes constructing a ReadMe less time consuming, allowing more time to work on the project itself. This is the first time I have used node.js and inquirer. It was a steep learning curve, but I was able to produce the desired mvp.


## Usage

In order to run this project you will need to open the files in vs code , open the command line, and run the command 'node index.js'. You will then be presented with the command line prompts. Answer each one, and then the project will automatically generate a ReadMe file based on your answers.
